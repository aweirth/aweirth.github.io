      1. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development is suing Facebook for allegedly 
      violating the Fair Housing Act by allowing housing discrimination on their platform. This discrimination
      comes from ad serving algorithims that are serving a select group of ads based on factors 
      such as the race of the user which allows facebook to basically draw lines of where to house people based on race. <br><br>
    </div>
    2. How the algorthims are able to do this is through filtering housing ads to not appear fo certain people who might be of a certain 
    race, income, or have a disabillity. Facebook gave the option to large ad companies to exclude viewers of their ads based on 
    non-American-born, non-Christian, interested in Hispanic culture, and ZIP code. <br><br>

    3. Facebook settled with several civil rights and housing advocates for a reported $5 million dollars which seems like not much at 
    all to me for a practice that is inherently and brutally racist and uninclusive. <br><br>

    4. Facebook promised reforms after previous reports of allowing advertisers access to filters referred to as "Ethnic Affinities," 
    but a follow-up report found a significant lapse in Facebook's monitoring of advertisers. Also reported was that facebook was "working"
    with the housing and urban Development department and was suprised by the lawsuit which makes me think they were taking no action at 
    all to fix their ad algorithims. <br><br>

    5. Algorithms can perpetuate and reinforce discriminatory practices. In the case of Facebook, the use of ad algorithms that 
    discriminated against certain groups of people could have reinforced and perpetuated systemic discrimination in the housing market and 
    society as a whole. This shows how algorithms can have real-world consequences and amplify existing inequalities. <br><br>

    6. Examples such as this show how some large tech algorithims must be held accountable and be public to some extent because This
    is only one example and there could be so much more going on behind the scenes at facebook or a range of other social media
    giants. <br><br>

    7. One thing I thought about was what if the algorithims could be used in sort of an opposite way? Not to discriminate or keep
    other people groups out of certain information but is there a way to educate more people on this issue? To possibly educate people
    on why they are getting a certain ad? Is the best type of ads something you should be responsible for? I feel like left to their devices
    this case is totally reasonable to expect out of big tech and advertisers. <br><br>

    8. Do you think the settlement was reasonable? Or more of a slap on the wrist to facebook for not cooperating with the HUD enough?
