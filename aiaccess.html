                <strong>Artificial intelligence technology is making huge steps towards inclusivity in education and the business world as highlighted by the article “How AI Is Improving Accessibility” by Malini Boorgu; fundamental speech learning is becoming more accessible and workplace equality and improved resources for neurodivergent people are rapidly improving every day.</strong> Teaching has been a huge area of where AI technology is promoting inclusivity in the classroom through assisting neurodivergent individuals. An example of this assistive technology is innervoice by Itherapy, which is able to identify objects in a person's surroundings and show and demonstrate uses of them through gifs. Furthermore, the app has a feature where the user can create a 3D avatar of themselves which can talk to them, allowing neurodivergent people to visualize themselves speaking to promote learning and speech practice. After reading the about section of the innervoice app on their website, one interesting thing I hadn't considered was the use of the app to express emotion which I know is something that can be hard for neurodivergent individuals; this is a feature I believe goes deeper than assisting learning and is tackling issues that only very skilled human teaching could once do. Through this example we can see the AI in the classroom is assisting the needs of neurodivergent people by creating new ways to learn, also by using technology to visualize speech, neurodivergent people have new ways to recognize and practice speech that was once not available. Another way in which AI is revolutionizing inclusivity of neurodivergent people is in the job market. The article mentioned how businesses such as salesforce are using AI to summarize large bodies of text to create easier to understand writing, however that did not seem very revolutionary to me. What was very encouraging was how the article talked about the changing job market and how it is benefitting neurodivergent individuals. The presence of AI technology in industry is creating a demand for people that are able to take on technologically inclined repetitive tasks without burnout as well as important jobs in analytics, math, pattern recognition, and information processing; all of which are tasks that are proven to be best suited for neurodivergent individuals. Some companies are even creating programs to explicitly hire and train neurodivergent people who in turn can then train more neurodivergent people. EY’s center of excellence does just that and is a leading example for these companies. All of this is creating a higher demand for neurodivergent hiring, better working conditions, and a bright future for AI inclusivity. One question that came to my mind during the reading is if this is a correct way to promote inclusivity in the workplace? It seems like giving repetitive tasks (that for the typical individual would cause burn out) is dishing off the painful work to people that might more easily say yes. I think the article needs to give a little more context about these “tasks”; is it just low level tasks that are being passed off to the people that will do it without question? Or are these complex problems that are pushing neurodivergent people to be a key component of a business?
