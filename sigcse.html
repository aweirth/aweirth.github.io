                <strong>Dr. Nicki Washington gives a call to action to her readers and to the members/chairs of SIGCSE that their organization and processes must change as they are rooted in whiteness, elitism, exclusivity and “strike down anything related to broadening participation or DEI in computing that doesn’t center whiteness” which is truly problematic for an organization whose methods are based in the principles of peer review and consensus.</strong> The author also makes the claim that as a whole, the CS community tends to expect everyone to go “with” the grain and accept what has already been well established a long time ago. The author of the post is reviewing the denial of their submission to the 2023 SIGCSE panel which was denied in a wrongful, non inclusive way which she provides thorough refutation for their denial. First the reviewers claimed that her proposal was not relevant to the theme of the summit however one reviewers claimed it would be relevant to ask a panelist about K-16 CS education but it would depend on how the panelist answered which the author is extremely frustrated about since she cannot predict the future and what the panelist will answer. The author also responds to claims of the reviewers saying that the session would be uncertain to run smoothly in a hybrid format for which she acknowledges but claims that it could be easily remedied. Also another problem with the reviewers claims is that the prompt never asked for addressing how audience participation would work or concerns about the audience structure; the only topic that needed to be addressed was panelist participation. This brings up another large idea of the authors which is that the prompt and submission guidelines were not accessible or easy to understand at all as first the prompts were unclear and the proposers are only given two pages which is asking for so much information to be squeezed into such a small amount. The author notes that she was also largely criticized for only having one citation but the prompt only called for citations where needed. It sounds to me like so much could be done in a more accessible way to people submitting a proposal; what are some things that could change the structure of proposals? The reviewers also claimed that K-16 CS education questions would require “in-depth experts” (which seems just blatantly silly to me) and was definitely a way it seemed the reviewers brushed off the proposal, the proposal even had guidelines to include 4 panelists instead of 3 so that each would represent different disciplines in the panel. Overall the reviews (coming from the authors perspective) are unsupported and most of the responses seem like  ways to brush off the proposal which showcase the stagnant nature of the chairs which needs to change. What ways can you think of to make areas of CS more inclusive, especially the academic world of CS panels and information? I would also be curious to read others' perspectives about SIGCSE since this is my first knowledge of it and I have only seen one side of the issue.
