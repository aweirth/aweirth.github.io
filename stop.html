            While there have been improvements statistically in the most recent publication of the Statistical Transparency of Policing Report, there still remains much to improve to ensure decisions to tier 3 stops of motor vehicles are not racially biased or targeted especially for Latinx groups compared to normal odds for white people.<br><br>
        </div>
        The most recent release of the Statistical Transparency of Policing Report details a logistic regression model done to determine if decision to stop for police officers varied based on factors such as time of day where a person's race can be determined visually. While no significant discrepancies were found for tier 1 and 2 stops, there was one occurrence found of Sandy PD agency having a significantly higher Latinx stop rate compared to the white majority group. As seen below, Latinx individuals were 2.1 times more likely to be stopped by Sandy PD when compared to whites.  (note: Gervais PD was left out of significance due to a Bonferroni Correction based on the number of comparisons)

        While there are obviously corrections to be made internally regarding Sandy  PD, I believe while statistical significance is important there is still a general trend that needs to be corrected. Even though reports show there is not a statistically significant difference, There needs to be a general effort to move to more similar rates especially for tier 3 stops which are considered to be racially motivated. The last point I wanted to consider was the decision to stop in the context of housing which makes me think back to the housing issue with facebook when ads were racially discriminatory and not serving ads to people of a certain ethnic group. Just like a law enforcement stop being racially motivated by seeing a Latinx individual, facebook or another service such as zillow (for example purposes) could behind the scenes be denying people access to a community based on race. All of these issues need correction and continued research into how to combat these issues and monitor them with data reports such as this one.
