                    1. In “The ones who walk away from Omelas” the author asks the reader to imagine the city of Omelas and also consider their idea of a “perfect” society. While the suffering child is  a metaphor much like the city of Omelas it puts forth the concept that in society there must always be suffering and necessary evils.

                <br>
                <div>
                    2. For all the readers of this short story, is true happiness and every person's ideal picture of society achievable without suffering? Or is the metaphoric child always a part of society?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. The story explains that children in Omelas must learn of this suffering child between the ages of 8 and 12; Can you think of how this applies to our world or how humans learn of evil in the world?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. For those who will not stand for evil or inflicting punishment upon others for the greater good of society, they must create their own.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5. Are individuals who leave the city of Omelas really solving the problem? Is there something more that can be asked of these people to rid of evils in society?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6. The population of Omelas is not a naive, boring, unintelligent society blinded by its whimsical nature; the people are intelligent, aware, and no less than us in this class.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7. The author allows the reader to picture Omelas with whatever parts of life they see as pleasurable; free usage of drugs, consumption of alcohol, and meaningless co-population which results in children that will be loved and cared about by Omelas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    8. The captive child in the cellar room is symbolic of the presence of evil and wrong in society that everyone knows is there, and knows that as long as it remains there, they can continue to live their lives which they are happy and comfortable with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9. The presence of the child and the knowledge of its presence by society is what makes Omelas so unique and wonderful. “The poignancy of their music and profundity of their science” is a result of the child. It is because of the child that the children are treated and cared for so much by the city.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    10. Those who cannot stand being a part of the society that punishes this child walk out of Omelas, west or north, and continue on the road into the darkness somewhere unknown.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    11. The direction that these people who leave Omelas walk towards is a place “even less imaginable.” What could this place represent?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    12. The place that these individuals walk towards is described as being even more unimaginable than the happiness of Omelas; do you think this represents another unimaginable city? Or does it represent a place so unimaginable for the reason that it is so rare people would actually leave the comfort of the city of Omelas?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    13. The captive child is occasionally fed by a few people who are responsible for keeping it captive. Is it assumed that these people share the same pity or are forcibly by choice keeping it captive?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    14. Release of the captive child would in essence be the destruction of the city of Omelas in every way. All unique and important parts of the city would be lost, and in turn, more  children would be harmed as the city would no longer care for all of them.
